=head1 NAME

Math::Ryu::Debug - perl interface to Ryu (with added Debugging outputs).

=head1 FUNCTIONS

    As for the functions (of the same names) provided by Math::Ryu.
    Unlike the Math::Ryu functions, the Math::Ryu::Debug counterparts
    also output some intermediate results that could be useful for
    tracking and/or debugging.
    That's the only difference.
    See the Math::Ryu documentation for details re the functionality.

    NOTE:
      It's advisable to avoid importing these functions simultaneously
      into both the Math::Ryu and Math::Ryu::Debug namespaces. Doing
      so will probably lead only to confusion.
      If warnings are enabled, you will receive a warning for any and
      all functions that are imported into both namespaces.
