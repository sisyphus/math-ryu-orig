0.08

0.07
     - Workaround bugs in old shit perls - ie perls prior to 5.30.0.
       (Math-Ryu-0.06 failed to allow for these bugs in some of the test sripts
       and I don't know if 0.07 covers them entirely ... time will tell.)

0.06 - Extra tests added to t/mpfr_checks.t and n2s.t.
     - Add new function fmtpy() - and also add t/reformat.t to test it.
     - Silence pointless compilation warnings generated by the XS files

0.05 - Add n2s function - same as d2s except that n2s also does what you mean
       when its given argument is an integer (IV/UV) or a string (PV).

0.04
     - Add _has_uint128() function (in both d2fixed.c files and both .xs files)
     - Patch s2d.c and Debug/s2d.c so that 32-bit Visual Studio (which does not
       provide the _BitScanReverse64 function) can build Math::Ryu.

0.03
     - Expand coverage to include environments that don't provide __uint128_t
     - Add Math::Ryu::Debug.
     - Add s2d().
     - Ensure that Newxz() is defined.

0.02
     - Fix big in t/mpfr_checks.t (No allowance was being made for the possibility
       that atonv() or nvtoa() might not be available.

0.01 - First release.
