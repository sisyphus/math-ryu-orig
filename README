Interface to the C implementation of Ryu at:
https://github.com/ulfjack/ryu/tree/master/ryu.

At the moment this implementation cover only single and double
precision C data types.
Therefore, it's not currently usable with perl builds whose
$Config{nvsize} > 8.

Building Math::Ryu also requires that the __uint128_t data type
is available. (IME, this rules out 32-bit builds.)

1) Clone the repository:
   $ git clone https://github.com/ulfjack/ryu.git /home/me/ryu

2) cd to /home/me/ryu and run:
   i)   make
   ii)  make test
   iii) make PREFIX=/home/me/libraries/ryu install
   iv)  make clean (optional)

If /home/me/libraries/ryu/include is searched for header files by default
&& /home/me/libraries/ryu/lib is searched for library files by default
then you can install Math::Ryu by running:

$ cpan -i Math::Ryu
